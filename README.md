## About The Project

[![dLike setup website](.readme/dlike-new-widget-example.gif)](https://dlike.qm64.tech/)


This widget uses IPFS and OrbitDB to have a fully decentralised and p2p 
"Like button" in the browser without any servers or FaaS. 
**Important Note**: This project is just an experiment and far from being 
production ready! 

This is a [Qm64](https://qm64.tech) experiment!

## Getting Started
To run the software locally you don't need any configuration or download. You 
can browse to [the setup page](https://dlike.qm64.tech/) and copy your HTML
snippet. On the setup page you can also create a widget or load an existing one 
by inserting the _dbkey_/Database Address.

If you instead want to modify the source code and run it locally you can follow
these steps.

### Prerequisites
To run this software you need:

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/Qm64/dlike.git
```
2. Run it locally
```sh
make run
```

This will run a local development server. Open a browser and visit 
[localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the setup page and test the 
changes.
